Sonder, yonder
 
God’s flame rises and I wake up, the birds aren’t chirping as you would expect but there’s the sound of welding machines and touts outside. I’ve always hated those things but I guess you get used to it. The ratio of apartments in the final stages of construction to liquor stores is almost 1:1
 
Nairobi has been expanding really fast lately, I walk in the CBD and the influx of people is very palpable, “hustlers”, they call themselves. There’s usually a tendency to reminisce with a sepia filter in the mind's eye, I think it’s just a “me” thing though. I miss the old days.
 
My father has always been adamant on me not calling myself a hustler, I guess it’s due to the negative connotations.
 
Today I'll not touch my laptop, there’s more to explore in real life. 
 
Sans laptop, sans smartphone, avec backpack. I walk out.
