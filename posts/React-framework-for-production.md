I'll start with a slight back story but don't fret, its not that much of a digress. Last week, I decided to apply for the chair position at GESA (Geospatial Engineering Students Association) in University of Nairobi. I was a bit skeptical to venture into untraversed waters but it is what it is, my chances were very slim but the experience was definitely worth it - story for another day.

I was assigned a time slot for the interview, but the universe had other plans. The energy in school was quite vibrant. Corporates and research seminars left, right and center so you couldn't entirely blame me for arriving a bit late to my interview. Furthermore, I'd like to believe there is a substantial number of people that are easily available via email than text messages - like me, so I was expecting an email with the interview details but woe unto me and my expectations.

Just before I was invited in, I met one of the GIS (Geographical Information Systems) lab technicians. We had a very enlightening conversation and he sent me into a rabbit hole - Next.js

What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that enables developers to build super fast and extremely user friendly web applications with minimum complexities.

It's widely used by popular companies all over the world like Netflix, Uber, Starbucks and Twitch.

- Image Optimization - Automatic image optimization with instant builds.

- Internationalization - Built-in domain and sub domain routing. Automatic language detection.

- Built in CSS support - create component-level styles with css modules.

- API Routes - Optionally create API endpoints to provide backend functionality.

- Hybrid - Pre render pages at build time or request time in a single project.

- Analytics - A true lighthouse score based on visitors data and page by page insights.

And more.

These features bring about a rich user experience, great performance and rapid feature development.

What are some pros of Next.js

- Great User Experience. (UX)

What are some cons of Next.js?

- Lack of an inbuilt state manager so if you need one you have to add a third party like redux.

Just like a coin has three sides, so does Next.js. Trade offs have to be made when building a web application with regards to the technology stack.

Uplift your page speed, SEO, and UX, and remember that technologies such as Next.js are making the web a better, cleaner, and more user-centric place.
